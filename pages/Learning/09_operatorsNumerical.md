title: Numerical Operators
---

Operators allow us to use logic on values to get a new value.  Addition and Subtraction in math is a common example of an operation.

#### Common numerical operators: <p>(in reverse order of operation prefrence)</p>
1. `+` addition, `-` subtraction
2. `\` division, `*` multiplication, `%` remainder (of division),
3. `**` exponentiation,
4. `=` assignment

*shorthands:*
work only with numerical variables not numbers themselves.

`++` increment, `--` decrement

these can either be before a variable or after but may yield different results depending how they are used.
