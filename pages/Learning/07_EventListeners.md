title: Event Listeners
---

Event Listeners are how you enable an element to respond to different events.  By default events bubble down the DOM tree so that a single action can trigger multiple events.

## Event Listeners
* add event listener: `mySelection.addEventListener('click', foo);`
#### Common Event Listeners
* `onload` -- when the page loads
* `onclick` -- when a user clicks something
* `onmouseover` -- when a user mouses over something
* `onfocus` -- when a user puts the cursor in a form field
* `onblur` -- When a user leaves a form field
