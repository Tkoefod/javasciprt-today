## What is the DOM?

The DOM is short acronym for "Document Object Model".  This is basically everything you see in the web browser. You write HTML that gets transformed by the browser into the DOM. You write javaScript that changes parts of the DOM.

With some very simple and quick coding you'll be able to enhance HTML documents greatly.  In the past the majority of people used jQuery library to interact with the DOM.  We don't need this anymore now that browsers have standardized most aspects of this. JavaScript has also greatly evolved to include methods to allow us to select and interact with the browser DOM more easily without the need for 3rd party libraries just as jQuery.

It is important to keep in mind that the DOM is what the web-browser creates and shows you it is not the HTML or the javaScript or even the combination of these things these things are only instructions to the web-browser on how it should build the DOM.
