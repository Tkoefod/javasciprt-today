title: What you need to get started

##### What do you need to get started with javaScript and follow along with my articles?

1. A computer, this doesn't have to be anything fast, super modern or specific.  Just about anything that can run a modern web browser will do.

2. A text editor of some sort.  If you don't already have a favorite code editor a popular choice among javaScript programmers is [Atom](https://atom.io/).
    - [List of many editors I have used through the years for different things.](http://koefod.us/wp/editors/)

3. A web browser.
      - which web browser you use really don't matter much for this use whatever fits you as long as it has the ability to show you the console & an inspector, both [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) & [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) are great at this.  I normally use [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) for a few extra nice tools it has but I will not be going into those at all.

that's all you really need, fairly simple right?

##### Some useful tools that you don't need now but might want.

- To use a lot of tools for javaScript you'll need to run Node.js on your machine, I won't be going into details here on how to get it up and running but the [ Node.js site is wonderful for getting up and running.](https://nodejs.org)

- A good terminal (any should work but below are some personal suggestions).
  - Mac: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com)
  - Windows: [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
  - Linux: [Terminator](http://cmder.net/)

- A good programming font

    This should be a monospaced and Sans font with good character differences (l,i,1,| should be easy to tell apart).  If you are using Windows you probably have 'Consolas' already installed and if you are using Mac you likely have 'Menlo' installed and both are good programming fonts. Some good fonts I have seen are listed below.
    - Menlo
    - [Consolas](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=300)
    - [DejaVu Sans Mono](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)
    - [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
    - [Hack](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
    - [Ubuntu monospaced](http://font.ubuntu.com/)
    - [Inconsolata-g](http://leonardo-m.livejournal.com/77079.html)
