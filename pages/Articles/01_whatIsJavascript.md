##### What is nodeJS and how does it differ from regular javaScript?

Regular javaScript or javaScript that people normally refer to when they speak of it is javaScript that runs in the client's web browser.  We write some code and include it inside the html of the document (inside script tags) or we use script tags (normally) to download a separate javaScript file that will start executing as soon as its finished downloading.

NodeJS is javaScript that runs on the server instead of the client. It can be used to run a web-server or do many different tasks.  Sometimes this is used instead of older Perl, Python, PHP, etc...
