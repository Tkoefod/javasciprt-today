title: Getting Started with javaScript

There is a lot to learn in modern javaScript Development but that shouldn't scare you because also there are great things you can do with knowing only a little bit of it and then while you are using it continue you learn as you go.  Modern javaScript eco-system is really great and mature now and allows you to get down to doing Development without worrying a whole lot about whether all browsers support it.
